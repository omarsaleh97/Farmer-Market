  The application will be similar to the Mobile Ordering system where customers may place their order online and confirm their proximity to the market via location of the device.  The vendor can confirm their order accept payment by Stripe and let the customer know where they can pickup the order.  If desired, the vendor can confirm the customer by flashing the flash on their device.  The entire transaction can take place without any personal contact.
